# scripts.yml - src/config/scripts.yml #

#  List of scripts, in order, that get asynchronously loaded as modules on KAMAR pages.
#  Note that if an error occurs in a script, it doesn't halt the execution of the next scripts.
#  Don't forget to append your script(s) in "web_accessible_resources" in manifest.json.

#  Note from Solar: It is crucial that the first 3 (themes, navbar, settings) are in the correct order otherwise things may not load as intended.
