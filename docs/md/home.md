# Welcome to the BetterKMR documentation!
This is not the website's permanent location - when the repository goes public, it will be moved onto GitHub pages.

## Welcome to DocHaste
Feel free to have a look around DocHaste to see how it works - it's relatively simple!\
DocHaste supports Markdown, for example:

```
## Hello!
It seems you're new, how's it going?
```

That above is a code block. You can surround what you want with three backticks (`).\
If you want to learn more syntax, check out the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

To start making your own documentation, check out `docs.json` and play around with it.\
To configure **DocHaste**, have a look at `settings.json`, but only tweak it if you know what you're doing.

###### *(By default, the markdown engine used is `markdown-it`. You can change "md-engine" to `marked` in `settings.json` if you like.)*
