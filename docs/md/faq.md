## Why doesn't the extension work properly when I download the .zip from the main branch?
This is because the intention of BetterKMR is to be built before it can be actually used.
You can either:
- Get BetterKMR from the Chrome Web Store *(recommended)*.
- Use the prebuilt versions from the [releases page](https://github.com/Interlabs-Official/BetterKMR/releases) or the [GitHub workflow runs](https://github.com/Interlabs-Official/BetterKMR/actions) for cutting-edge development builds.
- Build BetterKMR yourself. You can find the instructions at the "Building & Developing" section in Guides.
